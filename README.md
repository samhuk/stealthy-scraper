## Overview

stealthy-scraper is a wrapper around [puppeteer-extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra) that adds additional stealth functionality and other helpful features.

## Why to use

* If puppeteer's `Page.goto` and `Browser.newPage` is being detected. stealthy-scraper has a `newBrowser` function as an alternative way to navigate to a new url which is more reliable.
* If puppeteer's default word typing is being detected. stealthy-scraper has a `safeType` function that better mimicks human typing behavior.
* When you want to more neatly centralize all of the puppeteer, puppeteer-extra, and puppeteer-extra's plugin dependencies into one package.

## Usage Overview

`npm i --save stealthy-scraper`

```typescript
import { createScraper } from 'stealthy-scraper'
const scraper = await createScraper({
  puppeteerOptions: {
    headless: true,
    ...
  },
  snapshotsDirPath: './scraper-snapshots',
})
await scraper.page.goto('difficultoscrape.com')
const searchTextInput = await scraper.page.waitForSelector('...')
await scraper.safeType(searchTextInput, 'my search term')
// ...
await scraper.newBrowser(newUrlFromSearchResults)
await scraper.close()
```
